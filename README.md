# API-based-Weather-WebApp
 I applied all that I have learnt about APIs (Application Programming Interface) thus far and putting our knowledge to the test. I will be building a simple weather web application that will obtain the user location from the browser and pass on the data to the Weather API service provider.Â

# Simple Weather Web Application

In this tutorial, we will build a simple weather web application that leverages APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to obtain the user's location from the browser and fetch weather data from a Weather API service provider. We will be using the same API key and provider from the previous tutorial, so make sure you have your API key ready.

## Project Overview

This project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to create a user-friendly weather web application. It demonstrates how to:

- Utilize the browser's geolocation feature to determine the user's location.
- Make an HTTP request to a Weather API to fetch weather data.
- Display the weather information to the user in a user-friendly format.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luisrpavanelli/API-BASED-WEATHER-WEBAPP.git

Open the Project: Navigate to the project directory and open it in your code editor of choice.

API Key Setup:

Ensure you have your Weather API key ready. You can obtain one from the Weather API service provider.

Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE in the JavaScript file (script.js) with your actual API key.

Run the Application: Open the index.html file in your web browser to run the weather web application.

# Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
main.css: The CSS file for styling the web page.
main.js: The JavaScript file that handles geolocation and API requests.
